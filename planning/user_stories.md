# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Cesar, Ana, Nara**

## Problem Statement

"For today's health-conscious and time-pressed individuals, finding the right recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home can be a daunting task. This often leads to unnecessary food waste and meal repetition. The challenge is to develop an intuitive application that suggests diverse recipes using ingredients currently available at the user's home. This application should also cater to various dietary preferences, preparation times, and skill levels, effectively making meal planning more efficient and personalized, and significantly reducing food waste."
